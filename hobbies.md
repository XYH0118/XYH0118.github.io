Hiking helps me clear my mind, rejuvenate my body, and gives me the strength to tackle any challenges. I thoroughly enjoy the serenity of being surrounded by nature while on the trail. Over the years, I have participated in numerous hiking expeditions, challenging myself with various terrains and distances. Completed multiple **100-kilometer hiking challenges**. Recently, I've also developed an interest in long-distance running, further expanding my love for outdoor activities.


## Workshop

<br>There must be **something truly magical** about standing on stage to give a fantastic speech, which considerably lifts my spirits and energizes my entire body. If you desire to master a specific knowledge in depth, just give a prelection. If you can explain to others for complete understanding, you are already an expert. I really enjoy the accomplishment of imparting my knowledge to others, so what I strive for is to be **a student's favorite professor** at the [best universities in my hometown].

## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed long-distance running, [vlog making](https://space.bilibili.com/594030035), and computer game developing/playing. However, I have no time to do any of these things recently.
