<br>Hiking helps me clear my mind, rejuvenate my body, and gives me the strength to tackle any challenges. I thoroughly enjoy the serenity of being surrounded by nature while on the trail. Over the years, I have participated in numerous hiking expeditions, challenging myself with various terrains and distances. Completed multiple **100-kilometer hiking challenges**. Recently, I've also developed an interest in long-distance running, further expanding my love for outdoor activities.
